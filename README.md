 Five diagrams that reflect in a statistical manner different relations between different variables among the recipes database. That allows the user to easily diferenciate between authors and type of cuisine, for instance and many other different relationships. They are realized with dc.js, crossfilter, queue, and d3.js. 

In this formular I didn't added the upvotes function, that is only available in the __recipes detail view__

Once logged in the user will be presented with their dashboard which provides a count of their recipes, along with 3 data charts depicting the number of base ingredients, meal types and food flavours associated with the recipes which have been added.
Contact - Delivers the user to the contact page. This page displays a blank form, which allows users to contact the website developers to offer feedback and suggestions (not currently wired up to an email address as this is not a real business).

#### Working Features

This is a web application which allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. It is a full stack web application (**_frontend and backend_**) that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database hosted and available on Heroku platform as a service. Here users can :

1. **Create** or ad a recipe to the Mongo Db database with the inclusion of different fields, such as time of preparation, food description, gluten free friendly, etc.
2. **Read** from the data base the files there founded, and retrieve them to the app in a variaty of details. With this I mean that the user can see a list of the recipes, ##_sorted by pagination yet to be implemented_**........, or can select each recipe in a unique page and inspect it with all the specifications available. Also is retrived a list with the types of cuisines **_authors, predominant groups, upvotes_**
3. **Update** the recipes cuisines, and their properties in a easy quick way by the users needs and likes
4. **Delete** a recipe or a cuisine type,**_author, group,etc_.......** , alway after a modal security question that informs the user that he is going to delete forever the file.

5. **Dashboard** displays a graphic relation between cooking time, preparation tyme, cuisine name, author name and food groups
6. **Search and sort** function allow the user to search by word among the database, and the sort function orders the list under different criteria such as author, predominant group, etc.
 Also contains a dc.js **Interactive Graphic** , some **modal dialogues** used to advert the user that is going to delete a record, and **pagination** that allows the user to move through the web page.
In addition I tried to implement a simple log in function that it works .
 

#### Features Left to Implement

1. Export to PDF, download a recipe.
2. Expand the recipes with videos, more alergens and probably the option of buying a cooking book.
2. Improve the recipes presentation.
3. Improve the search function.
4. Asign each recipe to an user and have a record about that

### Technologies Used

* **_HTML, CSS, JaveScript_** with the help of jQuery fot the front end code

* **_Materialize, Front awsome_** for the display, templates and icons

* **_Python, Flask** worked to connect the backend database to the frontend

* ** Mongo Db_** a not SQl database non-relational approach. These datastores do not require fixed table schemas and try to avoid joins.

* **_Heroku_**  Platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

* **_TravisCl_** continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

* **_Flask_testing_** used to test framework functionality and its coninuous integration to Flask app and database (SQL or NON SQL)

* **_Unittest_** was used to build the testing framework.


### Testing 

### Responsive Testing

 ***********The app was tested on Samsung S8, Apple iPhone 6, etc,(all the deviced served in the Chrome developer tools) and also using the Google Chrome inspect feature to test for repsonsiveness and any errors that occurred. There were many issues founded most of them with the css sidevar/ navbar not resizing, card etc. Also this tool is usefull ,using their console, in founding java errors,retrieving the raw data from the data base, and proving the flask sessions reliability.

### Deployment



### Challenges

* Learning how to integrate Flask and MongoDB was a great learning experience. I learned much from how to manage and interact with a NoSQL data store. I saw that a good organized database gives powers to a novel programmer like me.

* Managing routes and URL's with Flask was also very interesting and I learned a powerful feature from reading the documentation around Flask and MongoDB. This feature gives speed and facilitate the work of a programmer.

* Implementing, or trying to extra features, such as pagination, user login that have taught me a parallel way of learning out of the course box, that I think I will be using in all my future carrer.

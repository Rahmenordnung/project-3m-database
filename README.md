# Cookbook Milestone Project (Tudor George Pascu)

## Name

Belly convent, the project name was chosen because the user as he enters the page will be converted, for a litlle while , to a world of superiour cuisine aplied in various locations all over the world. Sometime will be the case that is a high class cuisine, other that will be a very famour recipe that represents so well a type of cuisine and it tastes so well that gain its own place among the Belly cuisine.

There is also links to the **Recipes**, **Add (recipes)**, **Graphs**, **Preferences** that contains a _dropdown_ with **Cuisine**, **Chefs**, **Courses**, **Food Group**. The navbar will appear on all pages.

#### __Belly Convent__  
 
* Or Recipes is a __list of recipes__ that at the same time is the Home page. This consist of the recipes list containing  the recipe name and their food group shown in a __acordeon__ that if *clicked* will display a small intro acout the recipe. Before each recipe name there are __two options__, one is for **editing** the recipe and one is for **viewing the full recipe**, preceded by a **glyphicon**.
    * The __editing button__ edites the recipe in all the fields that are available in the database.
    * The __red arrow__ redirects the user to the recipe __full detail__, differentiated from the small preview present in the accordeon. This full detailed page consits of all the data present in the database, image, name, prep-time, etc
* __Sorting dropdown__ above the list, delievers different parameters to order the recipe list.
* __The Search box__ offers the user the function of searching by words in the data-base
* __Pagination__ is present in the Recipe list and in the searching results if required by the results number
* __Add Recipe__ is a green button that redirects the user to the add recipe page
* __Footer__ contains a copyright text, a link to a restaurant with the same name, and social media icons to different cooking pages.

#### __Add Recipe__ 

 Contains a formular that takes data in different fiels and saves it into the Mongo Db database. This Fields are:

* Gluten free (checkbox)
* Cooking Time(slidebar)

#### __Graphics__
 Five diagrams that reflect in a statistical manner different relations between different variables among the recipes database. That allows the user to easily diferenciate between authors and type of cuisine, for instance and many other different relationships. They are realized with dc.js, crossfilter, queue, and d3.js. 

In this formular I didn't added the upvotes function, that is only available in the __recipes detail view__

## Preferences

#### __Cuisines__

Presents a list of the cuisines types and also it integrates two small buttons _edit_ and _delete_. But this time the buttons edit / delete the cuisine type and not the recipe.

#### Working Features

This is a web application which allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. It is a full stack web application (**_frontend and backend_**) that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to a database hosted and available on Heroku platform as a service. Here users can :

1. **Create** or ad a recipe to the Mongo Db database with the inclusion of different fields, such as time of preparation, food description, gluten free friendly, etc.
2. **Read** from the data base the files there founded, and retrieve them to the app in a variaty of details. With this I mean that the user can see a list of the recipes, ##_sorted by pagination yet to be implemented_**........, or can select each recipe in a unique page and inspect it with all the specifications available. Also is retrived a list with the types of cuisines **_authors, predominant groups, upvotes_**
3. **Update** the recipes cuisines, and their properties in a easy quick way by the users needs and likes
4. **Delete** a recipe or a cuisine type,**_author, group,etc_.......** , alway after a modal security question that informs the user that he is going to delete forever the file.

5. **Dashboard** displays a graphic relation between cooking time, preparation tyme, cuisine name, author name and food groups
6. **Search and sort** function allow the user to search by word among the database, and the sort function orders the list under different criteria such as author, predominant group, etc.
 Also contains a dc.js **Interactive Graphic** , some **modal dialogues** used to advert the user that is going to delete a record, and **pagination** that allows the user to move through the web page.
In addition I tried to implement a simple log in function that it works .
 

#### Features Left to Implement

1. Export to PDF, download a recipe.
2. Expand the recipes with videos, more alergens and probably the option of buying a cooking book.
2. Improve the recipes presentation.
3. Improve the search function.
4. Asign each recipe to an user and have a record about that

### Technologies Used

* **_HTML, CSS, JaveScript_** with the help of jQuery fot the front end code

* **_Materialize, Front awsome_** for the display, templates and icons

* __Python__ This project uses Python, for general-purpose programming and used to write the logic of this game, which is included within .py files
* 
* Flask** worked to connect the backend database to the frontend

* ** Mongo Db_** a not SQl database non-relational approach. These datastores do not require fixed table schemas and try to avoid joins.

* **_Heroku_**  Platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

* **_TravisCl_** continuous integration service used to build and test software projects hosted at GitHub.

* **_Flask_testing_** used to test framework functionality and its coninuous integration to Flask app and database (SQL or NON SQL)

* **_Unittest_** was used to build the testing framework.


### Testing 

### Responsive Testing

 ***********The app was tested on Samsung S8, Apple iPhone 6, etc,(all the deviced served in the Chrome developer tools) and also using the Google Chrome inspect feature to test for repsonsiveness and any errors that occurred. There were many issues founded and the most critical for me was in the search function and in connection that with the main app and creation of sessions.

### Challenges

* Learning how to integrate Flask and MongoDB was a great learning experience. I learned much from how to manage and interact with a NoSQL data store. I saw that a good organized database gives powers to a novel programmer like me.

* Managing routes and URL's with Flask was also very interesting and I learned a powerful feature from reading the documentation around Flask and MongoDB. This feature gives speed and facilitate the work of a programmer.

* Implementing, or trying to extra features, such as pagination, user login that have taught me a parallel way of learning out of the course box, that I think I will be using in all my future carrer.
